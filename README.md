# React.js-Assignments
A web development assignment demonstrating the use of React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository contains the code for an assignment focused on building web applications using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates my understanding of front-end development concepts, including component-based architecture, state management, and styling techniques. The application uses React for building interactive UIs, HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions.

Features:

Responsive and mobile-friendly UI using CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout.

React components for modular and reusable UI elements.

State management in React using hooks like useState and useEffect.

Basic form handling and input validation in JavaScript.

Clear folder structure for easy scalability and maintenance.

Technologies Used:

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

HTML5: Markup language for structuring the web content.

CSS3: Styles for the web pages.

JavaScript: Scripting language for adding interactivity to the pages.
